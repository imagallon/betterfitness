## Description

This app is for users to be able to keep track of their workouts. I built this to get practice with MongoDB and Mongoose

## Installation

npm i

## Usage
This is the homepage. This will diplay the last workout you did. If there are none, It'll just say "you have not created a workout yet!"
Select New Workout for a new day, or continue Workout to add to your day
